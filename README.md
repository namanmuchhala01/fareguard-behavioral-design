# FareGuard: AI-Driven Fare Evasion Reduction System

## Project Overview

"FareGuard" is an innovative, AI-driven ecosystem designed to significantly reduce fare evasion in public transport systems. This project, developed as part of a case study competition at Università di Pavia, integrates geofencing, 3D sensors, and a user-friendly mobile application to create a comprehensive solution.

## Key Objectives

* Reduce fare evasion for STAV SpA by 15-20%.
* Improve compliance through automated checks and behavioral incentives.
* Enhance the overall passenger experience and operational efficiency.

## System Architecture

The "FareGuard" system comprises the following key components:

* **Geofencing:** Defines virtual boundaries around public transport entry/exit points to detect passenger movement.
* **3D Sensors:** Capture real-time passenger flow and validate ticket presence with high accuracy.
* **AI-Driven Analysis:** Processes sensor data to identify potential fare evasion incidents.
* **Mobile Application:** Provides passengers with:
    * Real-time ticket validation.
    * Rewards system based on compliance.
    * User-friendly interface.
* **Operator Dashboard:** Enables real-time monitoring of fare evasion rates and system performance.

## Behavioral Science Integration

"FareGuard" leverages key behavioral principles to encourage ticket validation:

* **Social Proof:** Displays real-time compliance rates to encourage conformity.
* **Reciprocity:** Rewards passengers for consistent ticket validation with points and incentives.
* **User Journey Mapping:** Detailed user journeys for high-risk groups (students, workers) were created to understand their behavior patterns and identify intervention points.

## Prototyping

* **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:** Developed a prototype dashboard for operators to visualize and analyze fare evasion data.
* **Rewards-Based Mobile App:** Created a functional prototype of the passenger app, showcasing the rewards system and ticket validation process.

## Projected Outcomes

* 15-20% reduction in fare evasion for STAV SpA.
* Increased revenue and operational efficiency.
* Enhanced passenger trust and satisfaction.
